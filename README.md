# Reinforcement-Learning-Car(In Progress)
Using Reinforcement Learning to train a car to park in a specific spot

Project Updates
Week One: Adjust Physics from https://rmgi.blog/pygame-2d-car-tutorial.html to something more realistic and practical for the build
--> potentially reduce the size of the car image to make the program look more aesthetic
--> the way the physics are designed currently, braking doesnt allow the user to fully stop... (may be due to the max_acceleration, and brake_val numbers --> subject to adjustment)
